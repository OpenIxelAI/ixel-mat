"""
The Models list in Settings: what each model on your panel can be set to, so nobody has to type a name.

Each list comes from the company whenever Ixel can ask it. A model Ixel calls itself shows its API's own
list, with the key it already uses. A program shows its company's list when Ixel has that company's key
(Claude Code: Anthropic's, Codex: OpenAI's, Gemini CLI: Google's), OpenCode shows the models it already
knows (`opencode models`, kept from fetching OpenCode's catalog), and a model server on your own computer
shows what it has. Otherwise the list built in below is
shown, and the page says so: it's a fallback that goes stale, while the live one doesn't.

Only model names reach the page. A key goes only to its own company (as with every question), never over
plain http to another computer, and nothing here changes the settings file.
