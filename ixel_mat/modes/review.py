/review — a panel of models answers, then grades each other, then agrees.

Rounds
  1. answer   every agent answers on its own; nobody sees another's answer
  2. review   every agent grades all answers, labeled A, B, C… with the
              authors hidden, flags concrete errors and picks the best one
  3. revise   (deep mode) every agent fixes its answer using the critiques
  4. verdict  a moderator writes the final answer from the answers + reviews

Modes: quick = 1 + 4, review = 1 + 2 + 4, deep = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4.

Saver mode spends less of your big model: the cheaper "drafters" do rounds
1 and 2, then one "verifier" (e.g. Opus) checks their work instead of
redoing it. If a draft is right it just names it ({"use": "B"}), so the
expensive model writes a few tokens instead of a whole answer. With
escalate="disagreement" it isn't called at all when the drafts clearly agree.

With Triage (triage.py, optional), a fast decision model is asked between rounds:
whether the first answers already agree (skip_review: peer review is then
skipped), and in saver mode whether the drafts agree before the verifier is
skipped. Triage failing never fails a run: the usual rounds just happen.

Scoring ignores what a model says about its own answer. When a reviewer
rates another answer above its own, that's recorded as a concession.

A follow-up question carries the last few questions and the panel's final
answers to them (`earlier=`), fenced like everything else a model wrote.

Code to review (`material=`, see material.py) goes into every round's prompt,
fenced the same way. Every call's tokens and cost are recorded (see usage.py).

Anything a model wrote is untrusted input to the next round. It is fenced
with a random per-run marker the text inside cannot forge, and every
prompt says fenced text is material to judge, never instructions.
