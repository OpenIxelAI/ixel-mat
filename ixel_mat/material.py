"""
What a question is about: a git diff, files you name (code, text, documents such as Word or PDF, and
pictures), or text you paste. Read-only.

Ixel reads it once, before the panel starts: it runs nothing in your project and changes
nothing, and the models get no file or shell access. The text goes into every round's prompt
fenced with the run's random marker, like everything else the user or a model wrote, so a
comment in it saying "ignore your instructions" is just more text to review. Documents are read
into text on this computer (documents.py); pictures, yours and the ones in documents, go to the
models that see pictures.

It's kept apart from the question: the question is what's saved for follow-ups and what Triage
sees, and the code shouldn't travel there.
