"""
Pictures attached to a question, for the models that can see them.

The Ixel window re-encodes each picture before sending it (at most 2048 px on a side), which already
drops what a camera writes into a photo. This side checks again: it takes only a PNG or JPEG it can
read the size of, takes out any metadata still in it (EXIF and GPS, XMP, comments, PNG text and
times), drops anything after the end of the image, and keeps it in memory only: for 30 minutes, at
most 64 MB in all, gone when Ixel stops. Nothing is written to disk.

They go to the models that see pictures (AgentConfig.sees_pictures): HTTP models whose API takes them,
and the subscription programs (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Copilot, OpenCode), each the way it takes
them, through your sign-in and with no API key. A program gets them as files in its run's own temp folder,
which goes when the run ends. The rest are told there's a picture they can't see.
