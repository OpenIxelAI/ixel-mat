"""
`ixel ask --agent NAME`: one of your models answers one question, with no panel and no review.

It's how other tools (Handoff's dispatch, the app's /handoff) give a job to one model you set
up in Ixel: "gemini, make me a list of projects to check out", or "codex, review my changes".
`--agent codex,claude,local` names a few, in the order you want them: when one is out of usage,
the next one answers (limits.py says what counts).
The model gets the same answer-only prompt a panel member gets, and code or files you attach
are fenced as material, so instructions inside them are something to read, not to follow.
Pictures attached (picture files, and the ones in documents) go along to a model that sees pictures;
one that doesn't is told they're there.
