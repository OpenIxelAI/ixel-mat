"""
Which thinking levels ("effort") each model really takes, so Settings offers only those and a question never
sends one its API would turn down.

Ixel's scale is EFFORT_LEVELS (minimal … max). Each model takes some of them, as its company documents: the
rules below were written from Anthropic's, OpenAI's, Google's and xAI's docs in October 2026, and each company's
last rule covers the models that come out after that. A level a model doesn't take goes to the nearest one it
does (minimal on GPT-6 is sent as low), and a model that takes none (Claude Haiku 4.5) gets none sent.

Programs are told what the program itself takes (Claude Code: low to max). Codex hands the level straight to
OpenAI, and Grok Build to xAI, so they get the levels their model takes as well. Gemini CLI and OpenCode take
none from Ixel.
