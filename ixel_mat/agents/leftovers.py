"""
What Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, OpenCode and Grok Build keep of a question Ixel asks them, and taking it away again.

Each of them saves every question and its answer under your home folder, and none has a switch that stops it
when it's run the way Ixel runs it (Claude Code and Codex have one, and their presets use it). So after a run
in Ixel's own empty temp folder, once the CLI has exited, Ixel removes what that run left, and only that:
never a login, a setting, or a session of yours.

- Gemini CLI: the run's folders in ~/.gemini/tmp and ~/.gemini/history (its chat, which has the question and
  the answer), each only if its .project_root names the run's folder, and the run's line in projects.json.
  The same in ~/.cache/.gemini, where it keeps them when its own sandbox is on, on a Mac.
- Copilot: Ixel gives the run a session id and a log folder of its own, then removes that session's folder
  in ~/.copilot/session-state, its lock, and its rows in ~/.copilot/session-store.db.
- OpenCode: the sessions whose folder is the run's folder, in each of its databases
  (~/.local/share/opencode/opencode*.db), with everything kept for them.
- Grok Build: each run gets a home folder of its own (GROK_HOME), with only a copy of your login in it, so
  none of your config, MCP servers, hooks, plugins, memory or sessions reaches it. Afterwards the folder goes,
  with the session it kept; a login Grok Build refreshed meanwhile is copied back first, if yours is still as it
  was. This happens in any folder, an agent's own workdir too.

Rows are deleted with SQLite's secure_delete on, and the database's write-ahead log is emptied afterwards, so
the text doesn't stay behind in free space. A run in a folder of yours (an agent's own workdir) is left alone:
your own sessions are kept there too. SECURITY.md lists what each CLI still keeps.
